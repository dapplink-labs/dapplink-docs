# DappLink Layer3

Modular and composable design tailored for large-scale decentralized application scenarios


## Overview

DappLink Network is a technology stack for large-scale decentralized application scenarios, and we are the first modular and composable Layer3 app chain solutions. For Layer3, modular is different from Layer2, the modularization of Layer3 is based on upper-Layer applications, and modules can be combined to serve upper-layer applications.
Our protocol design philosophy aims to Interconnect everything with Layer3 on blockchain, greatly reduces costs, improves security, and is designed from the perspective of users, developers, and benefiting mankind.


### Key Features of DappLink Network


#### Support for large-scale decentralized application scenarios
AppChain facilitates upper-layer business scenarios in a modular and composable manner. This modularity distinguishes itself from that of Layer 2. Layer 3â€™s modularity is specifically tailored to accommodate intricate upper-layer application scenarios. Diverse modules are employed to cater to various business scenarios, allowing for the flexible assembly of modules into upper-layer applications as required.

We acknowledge that different applications have diverse requirements for immediacy and security. For instance, real-time social networking and gaming prioritize immediate information interaction over stringent security needs. Conversely, asset custody prioritizes security as the top concern but may tolerate some delays. Utilizing the same data availability layer (DA) for all applications would inevitably result in unsatisfactory user experiences.

In the custody module, we have established a high-consensus network comprising multi-signature nodes. Fund transfers are only approved when the vote reaches a 2/3 majority, ensuring robust security measures. This setup, combined with the security provided by the staking protocol, offers dual-layer protection.

Different modules are operated by various types of nodes, all of which contribute to a shared staking pool. For instance, if 10 stakers collectively stake 100 ETH with the operator, the operator can concurrently run AppChain nodes across different modules. This arrangement enables efficient resource allocation and maximizes the utilization of staked assets across the network.

#### True integration of blockchain and AI
Layer3, which exists to carry large-scale applications, can not only process massive data, but also builds the cornerstone of large-scale applications on the future chain, covering all application scenarios such as social networking, games, custody and financial transactions. Its data availability layer module ensures the non-modification and credibility of data, providing a reliable training basis for AI. Dapplink's modular and composable Layer3 technology solutions will promote the in-depth integration between data and AI, making AI models trained based on massive data more intelligent, and pushing the combination of Web3 and AI into a new era.

#### High Security
Compared with applications deployed on Layer1 and Layer2, due to the limitations of the contract (the contract can be controlled by the project party), it is more decentralized and has higher security guarantees.

#### Low costs
Comparing Layer2 and Layer1 : Fees reduced by 7-90 times
Comparing Layer3 and Layer2 : Fees could reduce another 1000 times or more
